Decision Maker Algorithm


This is my Command-Line based decision maker algorithm. 
It helps a user narrow down their options in what they wish to pursue at the moment by allowing the user to choose a certain amount of 'voters' that will randomly select one of the options. 
If you can't decide on your own, why not let others help decide for you with no bias!
